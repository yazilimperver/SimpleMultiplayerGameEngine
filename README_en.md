# Snake V2 : Simple Multiplayer Game Engine Project

The main purpose of this project repository is to develop simple multiplayer game engine capability for our Snake game.
Check out: http://www.yazilimperver.com/index.php/2019/01/06/snake-v1-0/?lang=en

Moreover, I would like to show you thehow can we simply enable continous integration and unit testing for C++ projects in cross platform fashion using CMake as well as introduction of QT library. 

## Getting Started

I will explain **all these capabilities and QT** via separate **blog posts** which I will also add links here.

## Current Status of Repository

Here you can monitor the result of last continous integration build.
